# Set Tracker

Set Tracker is a self-built application that I built to help track my strength training progress in the gym. It leverages the Ionic & Angular, is written in TypeScript.

## The Problem it Solves

In the market there are many apps for that. But mostly they are freemium or premium (understandable). One day I had enough with this bullshit. And decide to create my own tracker.

## Features

- **Track Sets:** Easily record and track your strength training sets, including exercises, weights, repetitions.
- **Exercise Management:** Manage your exercises by adding, editing, and deleting them as needed.

## Deployed App

It will deploy to GH Pages

## Technologies Used

- **Angular:** Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript.
- **Ionic Framework:** Ionic empowers web developers to build leading cross-platform mobile apps and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

### Why I used Ionic

In the future, we can extend this application to mobile apps. And I don't want to create a UI library from scratch.

## API

I'm using [this](https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db) repository for exercise list. That's the only API currently using.

## The Not So Good

I created this app in one day and didn't sleep until finished. So it probably has bugs and bad coding (my coffee was finished in the middle).

Didn't add any tests (I know I shouldn't do that, but again it was urgent to finish project)

So if you have any improvements or future implements, you are free to help.

## Planned Futures

- **Edit Sets**: of course.
- **Add Tests**: ...
- **Unit change**: Currently there is only Metric system. I'll add imperial system.
- **Session & Set times**: Currently there are no times. I want to add rest time, etc.
- **Calendar view**: for general perspective for trainings
- **Share data between devices**: There will be no authentication, but I want to create something sharing your date between devices.
